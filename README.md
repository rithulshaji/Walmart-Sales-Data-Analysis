## Project Objectives

The primary goal is to gain insights into Walmart's sales data, understanding the factors impacting branch sales.

## Data Overview

The dataset contains 17 columns and 1000 rows, including information such as invoice ID, branch, city, customer type, gender, product line, unit price, quantity, VAT, total cost, date, time, payment method, COGS, gross margin percentage, gross income, and rating.

### Analysis Scope

1. **Product Analysis:** Understanding different product lines, identifying best-performing and underperforming lines.
2. **Sales Analysis:** Investigating sales trends to evaluate the effectiveness of sales strategies.
3. **Customer Analysis:** Uncovering customer segments, purchase trends, and segment profitability.

## Approach

1. **Data Wrangling:** This initial phase involves scrutinizing the data to detect and handle any null or missing values. The process includes building a database, creating tables, and inserting data. By setting fields as **NOT NULL** during table creation, the database filters out null values.
   
2. **Feature Engineering:** This step focuses on creating new columns derived from existing data to enhance insights:
   - Introduce `time_of_day` column categorizing sales into Morning, Afternoon, and Evening. This sheds light on the peak sales periods during the day.
   - Add `day_name` column extracting the day of the week for each transaction (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur, Fri). This aids in identifying the busiest days for each branch.
   - Implement `month_name` column to extract months of the year from transaction dates (Jan, Feb, Mar), facilitating analysis of monthly sales and profit trends.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  This phase involves a comprehensive exploration of the dataset to address the project's questions and objectives. EDA aims to extract meaningful insights by examining and visualizing the data to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset.

## Revenue and Profit Calculations

$ COGS = unitsPrice * quantity $

$ VAT = 5\% * COGS $

$VAT$ is added to the $COGS$ and this is what is billed to the customer.

$ total(gross_sales) = VAT + COGS $

$ grossProfit(grossIncome) = total(gross_sales) - COGS $

**Gross Margin** is gross profit expressed in percentage of the total(gross profit/revenue)

$ \text{Gross Margin} = \frac{\text{gross income}}{\text{total revenue}} $

<u>**Example with the first row in our DB:**</u>

**Data given:**

- $ \text{Unite Price} = 45.79 $
- $ \text{Quantity} = 7 $

$ COGS = 45.79 * 7 = 320.53 $

$ \text{VAT} = 5\% * COGS\\= 5\%  320.53 = 16.0265 $

$ total = VAT + COGS\\= 16.0265 + 320.53 = $336.5565$

$ \text{Gross Margin Percentage} = \frac{\text{gross income}}{\text{total revenue}}\\=\frac{16.0265}{336.5565} = 0.047619\\\approx 4.7619\% $
